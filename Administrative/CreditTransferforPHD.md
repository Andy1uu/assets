Dear Professor XXYY, 
 
My name is XXXX and I'm a first-year CS (Computer Science) Ph.D., student. I would like to request some credit transfer into consideration for my course work requirement. I have found the class that you teach might be equivalent to a course I took for my Masterâ€™s degree at XXXX. The class I would like to transfer is called YYYYYYY. I believe this course is equivalent to the course <XXXXXXX>  I received [A+] for the course, for your information.
 
Please let me know how I can proceed and if you need any further documents (e.g., transcript, syllabus). Below I attached the form that I need to get a signature from you for your reference. Thanks in advance for your help.
 
Best,
 
XXXXXXXX
