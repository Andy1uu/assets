          Our research goal is to create interactive systems that facilitate empathy. I am interested in the following research topics to realize the goal.
          Echolab is always interested in hearing from undergraduates and gradiate students with strong technical skills who are interested in creating novel interactive sysetm that can enhance our ways to empathize with other people!

            Programming is a challenging, time-consuming task that requires people recall broad sets of information. While modern development heavily relies on web resources for assistance, it leaves the end user to search for information sources, recognize an answer, and integrate it. This research direction aims to create mixed-initiative intelligent assistants to help programmers create software faster and more efficiently than ever before.

            Prototyping systems allows designers and developers to quickly get their ideas in front of real users, get feedback, and iterate on their designs. However, this is often itself a time-consuming process. This research direction aims to develop systems that let designers and developers prototype functional systems as quickly as they can describe them, providing unparalleled ability to rapidly iterate on ideas, even in live trials.

          <article class = "project-desc">
            Intelligent agents that converse with users in real-world spaces allow continuous, seamless task support beyond screen-based interactions, making these assistants easier to interact with and more available, reducing the cognitive overhead required to get support. This research direction explores situated interaction and conversation with intelligent assistants, intelligent sensing technology, and augmented collaboration between people.

            Live Writing is a research project that suggests an expressive form of written communication that transforms writing into a real-time experience. While written communication is indeed an essential way of communicating in various domains, from creative writing to social media, to writing program code. In this project, we investigate the benefits of presenting the live process of writing by means of real-time playback of a writing session to the readers in collaborative setup for context recovery and text comprehension. Live Writing draws upon ideas from the tradition of live coding in which the process of programming is revealed to the audience in real-time.
