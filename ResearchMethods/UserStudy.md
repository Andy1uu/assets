# Some advices for running user study

## Participate in other user study as much as possible
Almost all of students that I work with will run a user study. I think participating in other user studies as many as possible is a good opportunity for you to learn how to run a user study from others. Please participate in other study not  just for money but for you to experience how others do. Especially ones from psychology and social science if possible.

## Be nice.
If you think of it, it can be really intimidating. We ask them to come to a place that they don't know. they are asked to do something that they are not familiar with. We observe them. We question them. We ask them to justify their behavior. We ask them to sign the form. We ask them to talk to strangers. We ask them to speak aloud. So by default it is an intimidating process and you have to do your best job to create a comfortable atmosphere. I recall participating in a user study was a pleasant experience because of the professional but positive attitude of the moderator, which made me care about the atmosphere in a user study more.
