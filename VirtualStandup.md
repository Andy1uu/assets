# Virtual Standup Report

For anybody who does research in the lab should submit a Virtual Standup Report twice a week. There is no a separate submission system. Rather is ia one Google Docs document that you maintain on your own. The idea of standup meeting comes from software engineering industry. You just get together and talk about what you did the day before and what you will do on the particular day. For us, becuase we don't get together in the same place at the same time (maybe we should?), we do this virtually; submitting a brief report in a Google Docs. 

The goal of submitting Virtual Standup is two-foeld 1) *self-reflection* and 2) *regular communication with your peers (primarily your advisers)*. Use it to recall what you have done a last few days and to plan what you are going to do for the next few days. If you have done nothing, and if you are not going to do anything at all, still submit it. We want to have visibility on not being able to make any progress as well for self-reflection. 

Here is a sample virtual standup report: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hTWOfzuCnW8Qs8VYlUq1ubUQnNDSmf0cti57owHQBko 

## Rules
- The report will be shared within the lab. You can learn what other folks are doing by reading this. 
- On the top of the document, maintain a long-term to do list with associated due date. Everything has a due date. 
- Below the table it should have a report in descending order. 
  - Each report starts with the date of submission
  - It should contain the following three sections
    - (completed) the tasks that were compmleted since the last standup
    - (plan/in-progress) the tasks that you will work on until the next standup
    - (blockers) anything that kept (or keeps) from you making a progress (e.g. ilness, too much courseworkload, mid-term exam, collaborators, emotional challenges) Note that this repot is open to your colleagues so you should not write anytihng that you cannot open to peers for any reason.
- if a task appear in the (plan/in-progress), your goal is to make the item appear in the (completed) section). Make sure that you don't have any orphansed task items. This means that you plan something that you. 
- If you have done nothing for particular period, submit a empty report. Missing reports from time to time is fine. Unexpected things happen. However, if it becomes your habit, you want to keep track of this behavior and reflect on it too.
