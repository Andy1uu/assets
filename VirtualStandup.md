# Virtual Standup Report

For anybody who does research in the lab should submit a Virtual Standup Report twice a week. There is no a separate submission system. Rather is ia one Google Docs document that you maintain on your own. The idea of standup meeting comes from software engineering industry. You just get together and talk about what you did the day before and what you will do on the particular day. For us, becuase we don't get together in the same place at the same time (maybe we should?), we do this virtually; submitting a brief report in a Google Docs. 

The goal of submitting Virtual Standup is two-foeld 1) self-reflection and 2) regular communication with your adviser. Use it to recall what you have done a last few days and to plan what you are going to do for the next few days. If you have done nothing, and if you are not going to do anything at all, still submit it. We want to have visibility on not being able to make any progress as well for self-reflection. 

Here are some rules
- On the top of the document, maintain a long-term to do list with associated due date. Everything has a due date. 
- Below the table it should have a report in descending order.
