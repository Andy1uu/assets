Reading paper can be fun but recalling papers are not. If you do not synthesize something out from reaidng papers, it is likely that you get nothing out of it after a few months you read it unless you really love the papers. However, I would say there are a limited number of papers that you can love, which is much lower than the papers that you have to read if you would like to become a researcher. In that sense, logging papers that you read is esssential. You will recall more and more papers as you become senior but up to that point, you will simply read it and get nothing other than the good feeling. 

Therefore, I will ask everyone who does research with me to maintain an annotated biblography (or something equivalent) per a project. If you have any prefernece (or existing methods), the annotated biblography will be a simple Google Docs document that contains a collections of paper and the length of which grows over time. In the long run, I would recommend a biblography softwre such as EndNote, (which is free for Virginia Tech students as of now) as long as you can share it with me. A stack of papers with manual annotation is pretty good but it is not a good way for collaboration. However, other types of collaborative systems works e.g. Github, a Wordpress, Medium, etc. I would recommend something that requires minimal transaction costs. 

Each entry on one paper should include following information 
- Title of the paper
- Autohrs of the paper
- the most offficial url of the paper (e.g. ACM DL) 
- Brief summary of the paper (2~4 sentences) 
- Self reflection on the paper
  - how it relates to your project? 
  - in which purpose would you cite it. 


Therefore, I would ask you
