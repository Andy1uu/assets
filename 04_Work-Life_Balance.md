Note: This document is primarily for graduate studnets who does research (Ph.D. students, or master studnets who writes thesis). 

Assumption: The underlying assumption of having "work-life balance" in a research lab is, regardless how much you get paid, a graduate student is *a full time job*. 


## Lab Attendnace Policy 


## Working Hours Policy 

0. This is purely for research hours 
   - Not the hours you spend for other activities (etc., TA, coursework, services) 
1. *Know how much you want to work (Desire).*
2. *Keep track of your time (Reality).* 
   - Know how much you (actually) work. 
   - Hint: it is not the number of hours that you use your laptop nor the number of hours that you are in school. 
   - Actively keep track of your time. 
   - I recommend you to log your time in a paper notebook. (read this: https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/)
3. *Reduce the discrepancy.*: Match the reality with your desire, or adjust your desire to match your reality. Be honest with yourself.
4. *I don't care.*: I don't care about your desire(1) until 2 and 3 are are satisfied. If I have to care about your desire(1) because you are not making any meaningful progress even if 2 and 3 are satisfied, it is probably one of these cases: 
    - Your time tracking is incorrect. 
    - You are lying (to me or to yourself). 
    - You are not serious about this job (e.g., Your desire is to work 5 hours a week).
    - You are not intelligent enough to do research (e.g., You work 40 hrs a week but you are not getting anywhere). 
    - (Which one are you?) 

## Vacation Policy 

- Being a graduate student is tough and, (hopefully) You DESERVE time off without feeling guilty and work stress. This is important to recharge yourself and gain energey for upcoming semesters. (I call this recharge guilty feelings by doing nothing.). The only thing that I ask you is to let me know in advance so that I cancel the meeting and do not feel offended when you compeltely ignore me.
- a graduate student that I advise gets 15 working days off per year. One needs to tell me 2 X N working days before the off-days where N is the number of days that you are going to use for vacation. e.g. If you are going to take a day off on Monday, you have to tell me at latest Thursday (2 working days before Monday). 
- In the beginning of every academic year (September), you will get new 15 working days (sorry no rollover). 
- However, if not noted, I would assume that you will be working and responsive (online), regardless where you are. For example, without prior notice, I will be expecting you to work during the Winter break or Spring break (and I don't recommend that. You need a break) 
- Holidays defined by HR at VT are off by default. (You don't use vacation days on these days.) https://www.hr.vt.edu/benefits/leave/holiday-closing-schedule.html
- Being on a different physical location does not mean that you are forced to use your vacation day, you can be online and work remotely.
- You do not have to work on weekends or holidays (defined by HR at Virginia Tech) although you can if you would like to distribute your work flexibly. One of the benefits of being an academic is you can choose the times that you work, which means that you can distribute working hours in any way you want. However, I don't expect you to be responsive on weekends or holidays.
- Request your vacation without guilty feeling via this form. No questions asked if you follow the policy. https://forms.gle/kwFWymeUjbrp9gVZA
