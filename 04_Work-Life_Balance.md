Note: This document is primarily for graduate studnets who does research (Ph.D. students, or master studnets who writes thesis). 

Assumption: The underlying assumption of having "work-life balance" in a research lab is, regardless how much you get paid, a graduate student is a full time job. 


## Lab Attendnace Policy 


## Working Hours Policy 

0. This is purely for research hours 
   - Not the hours you spend for other activities (etc., TA, coursework, services) 
1. *Know how much you want to work (Desire).*
2. *Keep track of your time (Reality).* 
   - Know how much you (actually) work. 
   - Hint: it is not the number of hours that you use your laptop nor the number of hours that you are in school. 
   - Actively keep track of your time. 
   - I recommend you to log your time in a paper notebook. (read this: https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/)
3. *Reduce the discrepancy.*: Match the reality with your desire, or adjust your desire to match your reality. Be honest with yourself.
4. *I don't care.*: I don't care about your desire(1) until 2 and 3 are are satisfied. If I have to care about your desire(1) because you are not making any meaningful progress even if 2 and 3 are satisfied, it is probably one of these cases: 
    - Your time tracking is incorrect. 
    - You are lying (to me or to yourself). 
    - You are not serious about this job (e.g., Your desire is to work 5 hours a week).
    - You are not intelligent enough to do research (e.g., You work 40 hrs a week but you are not getting anywhere). 
    - (Which one are you?) 

## Vacation Policy 

- a Ph.D. student gets 15 working days off per year with 2 X N working days before where N is the number of date that you are going to use for vacation. e.g. If you are going to take a day off on Monday, you have to tell me at latest Thursday. 
- However, if not noted, I would assume that you will be online (responsive).  For example, without prior notice, I will be expecting you to work during the Winter break or Spring break.
- Being on a different physical location does not mean that you are forced to use your vacation day, you can be online and work remotely.
- You do not have to work on weekends or states holidays although you can if you would like to distribute your work flexibly.  One of the benefits of being an academic is you can choose the times that you work, which means that you can distribute working hours in any way you want. However, I don't expect you to be responsive on weekends or holidays.
