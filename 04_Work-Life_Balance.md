## Lab Attendnace Policy 

## Working Hours Policy 

## Vacation Policy 

- a Ph.D. student gets 15 working days off per year with 2 X N working days before where N is the number of date that you are going to use for vacation. e.g. If you are going to take a day off on Monday, you have to tell me at latest Thursday. 
- However, if not noted, I would assume that you will be online (responsive).  For example, without prior notice, I will be expecting you to work during the Winter break or Spring break.
- Being on a different physical location does not mean that you are forced to use your vacation day, you can be online and work remotely.
- You do not have to work on weekends or states holidays although you can if you would like to distribute your work flexibly.  One of the benefits of being an academic is you can choose the times that you work, which means that you can distribute working hours in any way you want. However, I don't expect you to be responsive on weekends or holidays.
