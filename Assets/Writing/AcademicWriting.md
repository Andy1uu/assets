# Tense

- (Past tense) 
  - when describing what people have done in the past. 
  - when describing what you did in your method (implementation / user study) 
- (Future tense) 
  - Nope. No future tense is used in academic writing unless it is a proposal. Not even for a future work. (Say we "plan to") unless you are 100% sure that you "will" do it, which cannot be true. 
- (Present perfect tense) 
  - When you want to say what people "have done". This means that there is a body of work that multiple researchers worked on the topic that you describe. 
- (Present tense) 
  - everything else.
