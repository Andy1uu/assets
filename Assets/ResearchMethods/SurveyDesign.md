Got some thoughts while I was working on a survey design, which I think it's nice to share this in a document. 

1) to think about the purpose of the questions. Think about kinds of sentences that you will be able to write in the paper. For example, if you want to have a sentence like "70% of the respondents prefer to use smartphones when they communicate with their family in their workplace." if that's the purpose, simply create a question that is quantifiable (with multiple choice questions rather than open-ended questions)

2) to elicit responses from respondents. We want to elicit responses from as many participants as possible? To that end, contextualizing the question always help to specify. For example, if I ask a person, "Do you have any problems in using smartphone in your workplace?" is vague enough to be interpreted in various ways and part of them will think "I don't have any problem with it. and answer the question with simple 'No'." The better approach is to have some hypotheses and to contextualize it over the series of questions, "While you are working, how often are you interrupted by smartphone notifications?" "How much time do you think you spend on your smartphones interruptions?". One way to think about it is to think of a survey question as a variable in a "strongly-typed" programming language (where you have to declare the variable type for every variable). Imagine what kinds of variable I need to store the answer. Boolean? Enumeration? Integer? Float? Double? String.  Note that if you want to count, "String" is not a good one because you have to annotate and categorize them one by one manually.

I am pretty sure there is a formal way to describe this but I have never learned the topic. If you are interested in these, please consider to take a formal courses like below.  This following course can count as a cognate course for CS Ph.D. students in Virginia Tech.
